## Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape
### Whats Is Machine Learning?
* Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
* A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with        experience E
### Types of Machine Learning Systems
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Semisupervised learning

## Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project
### Steps Taken in the Example Project
* Look at the big picture.
* Get the data.
* Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
* Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
* Select a model and train it.
* Fine-tune your model.
* Present your solution.
* Launch, monitor, and maintain your system

## Chapter 3: Classification
